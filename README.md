# Hey, I'm James!
I make stuff sometimes

### [mcutils](https://github.com/Jaimss/Jaims-Utils)
A minecraft utilities package that I made to make some stuff easier and a bit quicker to do.
The main thing it does it make it so your don't need to copy and paste that utilities file every time you make a new plugin.
### [jdautils](https://github.com/Jaimss/jdautils)
A [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) utilities package made for Kotlin development.
Gives useful features like permission/role checking easily, sending and cleaning up messages, etc.
